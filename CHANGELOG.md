# Changelog

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-20

### Added

- Initial Manifest V3 scaffold with React, TypeScript, Vite, Side Panel, Service Worker, and Content Script.
- Local queue model for X/Twitter composer URLs.
- Local storage repository, initial state machine, alarm scheduling, retry state, and attempt history.
- Safe X provider inspection that refuses to click when the page, composer, content, or enabled post button cannot be verified.
- Dynamic request for the specific external bank host permission when the user presses extraction.

### Known limitations

- The first scaffold does not yet include the complete restart recovery dialog, Refresh Bank diff view, or import/export UI.
- X selectors are best-effort and require maintenance when the site UI changes.
